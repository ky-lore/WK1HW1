# Homework assignment 01 Week 1
- In this project, I took the index HTML and style CSS files for a fully-functioning hypothetical website and improved upon the code structure in order to meet accessibility standards from a source code perspective.

# Changes and fixes
- Many non-semantic HTML element tags such as <div> and <span> were replaced with more appropriate semantic tags, such as <header>, <footer>, <section>, <aside>, <article>. 

- Redundant class designations for the respective non-semantic tags such as header and footer were removed in favor of redefining the attributes towards the semantic tag, rather than the class of the non-semantic tag.

- Added descriptive alt attributes to <img> tags both for user and developer clarity.

- Changed metadata information to reflect more appropriate website title.

- Optimized formatting such as indentation and whitespace for developer-side visual clarity.
